This is a online minesweeper game complete with all desktop functionalities including right and middle click.

It also contains a basic solving algorithm, which can aid you in finishing your game. Please be aware the algorithm can't shoot blindly (yet) and can't choose the most probable bomb positions (yet). It can only choose 100% bomb or 0% bomb placements. Probabilities will be calculated soon!

The basic algorithm should be mainly used, with the perimeter algorithm used if the basic fails. Please note the perimeter algorithm is complex, as it calculates all possible bomb combinations. It can therefore take a long time if the perimeters are long.

Enjoy!
